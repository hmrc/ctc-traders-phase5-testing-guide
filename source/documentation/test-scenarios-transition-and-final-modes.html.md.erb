# NCTS5 transition mode and final mode test scenarios

These test scenarios can be used at any time when checking that your software functions correctly and that it is compatible with HMRC systems. This is because the functionality that these scenarios demonstrate is always available irrespective of whether Trader Test is running in transition or final mode. Each scenario has an associated process flow in the [NCTS5 technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/).

Unless otherwise stated, all scenarios refer to a single house consignment going to a single consignee.

For each scenario, the relevant master reference data (see the NCTS5 Trader Test data spreadsheet in the [test pack](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/documentation/test-pack.html)) is indicated along with any changes to that data that are needed to test that scenario.
