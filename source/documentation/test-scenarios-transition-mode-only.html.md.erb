# NCTS5 transition mode only test scenarios

These test scenarios are designed to demonstrate the constraints of transitional conditions and technical rules when Trader Test is running in NCTS5 transition mode. Each scenario does not have any associated process flow in the [NCTS5 technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/).

Unless otherwise stated, all scenarios refer to a single house consignment going to a single consignee.

For each scenario, the relevant master reference data (see the NCTS5 Trader Test data spreadsheet in the [test pack](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/documentation/test-pack.html)) is indicated along with any changes to that data that are needed to test that scenario.
