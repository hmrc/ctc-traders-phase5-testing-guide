# CTC Traders API phase 5 testing guide

Verify the compatibility of your software with [CTC Traders API v2.0](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0) and learn how to test your application in our sandbox environment.

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [CTC Traders API phase 5 service guide](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-service-guide/).

We strongly advise you to start testing your software for compatibility purposes as soon as possible.

### Test environments

#### Trader Test

Trader Test simulates automated responses. It also provides an environment in which New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) support staff simulate the tasks done by Border Force personnel.

Trader Test enables you to check that your software is fully compatible with the CTC Traders API. Using Trader Test to validate the compatibility of your software is a prerequisite to being given access to the live production environment.

#### CTC Traders Test Support API

The CTC Traders Test Support API enables you to inject transit movement notifications as if they have been sent by the NCTS from a customs office of departure or destination. Until automated responses to trader messages are supported in a Trader Test environment, the API enables responses to be triggered manually. 

**Note:** The CTC Traders Test Support API is not a substitute for Trader Test. It will be switched off as soon as Trader Test becomes available.

You must make requests to the CTC Traders Test Support API in JSON format. The API injects messages in XML format.

For more information, see [CTC Traders Test Support API specification](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders-test-support/2.0).
