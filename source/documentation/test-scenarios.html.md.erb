# Test scenarios

Use these scenarios when checking that your software functions correctly and that it is compatible with HMRC systems.

**Important:** The test scenarios will be updated as we add more functionality to the NCTS5 Trader Test environment. You should monitor the changelog for this document in the [ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide](https://github.com/hmrc/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/wiki/CTC-Traders-API-phase-5-testing-guide-changelog) GitHub wiki.

Rules and conditions that apply to information exchange (IE) messages as defined in the [NCTS Phase 5 technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/) work differently for Great Britain and Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Although Northern Ireland is not an EU member state, compliance with the requirements of the Northern Ireland Protocol means that rules and conditions should be applied in the same way as for EU member states.

[CTC Traders API v2.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0) integrates with both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland versions of the NCTS test system. These operate identically to the Great Britain and Northern Ireland live versions of the NCTS system.

Unless otherwise stated, all scenarios refer to a single house consignment going to a single consignee.

For each scenario, the relevant master reference data (see the NCTS5 Trader Test data spreadsheet in the [test pack](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/documentation/test-pack.html)) is indicated along with any changes to that data that are needed to test that scenario. 

## Running test scenarios

Trader Test simulates both simplified and normal procedures. Simplified procedure declarations are released automatically, but a normal procedure declaration requires a manual intervention for it to be processed and released.

When you are testing a declaration that requires a manual intervention, please send an email to [nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk) to progress the declaration for release and include the following information in your email:

- email subject must include ‘Manual Intervention’
- email body must include:
  - the test scenario number, for example, ‘DSGB1’
  - the step number, for example, ‘step 3’, and action that you are expecting
  - the Local Reference Number (LRN)

NCTS support staff monitor the [nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk) mailbox during 9am to 5pm Mondays to Fridays and release test declarations regularly. When we release your movement, we will reply to your email to let you know. If you have not received an update about your movement request after 1 working day, please send a follow-up email to the declarant Test team mailbox.

**Note:** The [nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:nctsp5tradertest@hmrc.gov.uk) mailbox must be used only to request manual intervention. It should not be used for general enquiries.

**Note:** The automatic release period for scenarios using simplified departure procedure has been set to 45 minutes. This is to allow time for actions to be carried out where tests require manual intervention. In addition, the NCTS5 system reported time is 1 hour behind.

**Important:** You must follow the requirements and instructions for each test precisely and you must provide movement-specific information if requested.

### Message sender and recipient guidelines

There are guidelines for entering message sender and recipient details in arrivals and departures messages in the NCTS5 Trader Test environment that will also apply to the production version of the UK NCTS5 service.

#### Message sender

When specifying the message sender of an arrival or departure message, you can enter alphanumeric format data up to 35 characters (‘an..35‘).

We recommend that you should enter the EORI number of the organisation (‘the declarant‘) that is physically sending the message. Alternatively, if you do not know the EORI number of the declarant, you can use the EORI number of the transit movement or prompt for it.

#### Message recipient

From 26 July 2023, the NCTS5 Trader Test environment will enforce the following rules for message recipient details.

| Message type | Rule | GB to XI movements | XI to GB movements |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Arrival | You must enter ‘NTA‘ and the correct country code of the **actual** office of destination, which could be different from the declared office of destination. | NTA.XI | NTA.GB |
| Departure | You must enter ‘NTA‘ and the correct country code of the office of departure. | NTA.GB | NTA.XI |

The emphasis on GB to XI movements and XI to GB movements is specific to NCTS5 Trader Test. For the production version of the UK NCTS5 service, these rules will be applied to transit movements originating from or arriving in GB or XI. If your transit movements involve other CTC member countries, you will need to become familiar with the rules used by those countries for the message recipient field in NCTS5 arrivals and departures messages.

**Note:** The rules used by other CTC members for the message recipient field might be similar to but not necessarily the same as those used by the UK.
