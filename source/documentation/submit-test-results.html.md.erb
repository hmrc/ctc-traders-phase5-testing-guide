# Submit your test results

When you are confident that your software is fully compatible with our API and you want to apply for production credentials for our API:

- log all your evidence and test results by filling in all sections of the CTC Traders API Application for Production Credentials Checklist (pending) - you must also answer all of the questions at the end of the checklist
- when ready, email your completed form to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk)
- weâ€™ll check your test evidence using the information you provided in the checklist
- when we are satisfied that you have completed a sufficient level of testing, you will be granted access to the live API system

**Important:** Any test results submitted for accreditation must be less than 14 days old.

**Warning:** You will need to submit your application form and test results by 13 October 2023 if you want to have production credentials for the API before NCTS5 goes live on 16 November (day 1). You can still apply for credentials after 13 October but you would not be guaranteed to receive your credentials in time for day 1 or the first few days thereafter.

For more information about applying for production credentials, see [CTC Traders API phase 5 service guide](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-service-guide/).
