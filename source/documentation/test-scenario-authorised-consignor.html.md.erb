# Test scenarios

Use these scenarios when checking that your software functions correctly and that it is compatible with HMRC systems. You must test all scenarios for arrivals and departure movements to and from both Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (XI).

Rules and conditions that apply to information exchange (IE) messages as defined in the [NCTS Phase 5 technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/) work differently for Great Britain and Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Although Northern Ireland is not an EU member state, compliance with the requirements of the Northern Ireland Protocol means that rules and conditions should be applied in the same way as for EU member states.

[CTC Traders API v2.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0) integrates with both the Great Britain and Northern Ireland versions of the NCTS test system. These operate identically to the Great Britain and Northern Ireland live versions of the NCTS system.

Unless otherwise stated, all scenarios refer to a single house consignment going to a single consignee.
