# Apply for production credentials 

Production access testing in the NCTS5 Trader Test environment is split into 2 phases, so you will have 2 opportunities to apply for CTC Traders API v2.0 production credentials.

**Note:** Although you will need to apply for production credentials for the API only once, we recommend that you complete production access testing during both phases.

The production access testing phases are as follows.

| Phase | Scope | Start date | End date |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1 | NCTS5 transition rules only | 11 October 2023 | 2 February 2024 |
| 2 | NCTS5 final rules only | 5 February 2024 | (No end date) |

**Important:** If you have not gained production credentials before 4 February 2024 but you gain production credentials after 5 February 2024, your credentials will be based only on NCTS final rules and you will be unable to use the live API system until NCTS5 final rules are implemented. Therefore, depending on your operational needs before NCTS5 final rules are implemented, it might be in your interest to complete production access testing during phase 1 and apply for production credentials during that phase.

## **Production credentials applications during phase 1**

If you apply for production credentials during phase 1 and your application is successful:

- your credentials will be based on NCTS5 transition rules, but they will remain valid after NCTS5 final rules are implemented
- you will not be required to complete further production access testing during phase 2, but we recommend that you carry out production access testing for NCTS final rules and optionally submit your test results

You will need to submit your production credentials application form and production access test results by 31 October 2023 if you want to have production credentials for the API before the UK NCTS5 service goes live (day 1). You can still apply for credentials after 31 October, but you would not be guaranteed to receive your credentials in time for day 1 or the first few days thereafter.

If you submit your production access testing results and completed application after the UK NCTS5 service goes live, you will need to allow at least 2 weeks from the date you submit the completed form to our Software Developer Support Team before you move to production.

## **Production credentials applications during phase 2**

During phase 2, you will complete your NCTS5 final rules testing in NCTS5 Trader Test as part of your assurance testing.

If you do not gain production credentials for the API during phase 1, you will also have complete your NCTS5 final rules testing in NCTS5 Trader Test as part of your production access testing and then apply for production credentials during phase 2.

If your application is successful:

- your credentials will be based only on NCTS5 final rules
- you will be unable to use the live API system until NCTS5 final rules are implemented

Therefore, the only way to get access to the live API system as soon as possible after UK NCTS5 service goes live is to carry out production access testing during phase 1 and make a successful application for production credentials during phase 1.

## Submitting a production credentials application

When you are confident that your software is fully compatible with NCTS5 and you want to apply for production credentials for the API:

- log all your evidence and test results by filling in all sections of the CTC Traders API Application for Production Credentials Checklist (pending) - you must also answer all of the questions at the end of the checklist
- when ready, email your completed form to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk)
- we will check your test evidence using the information you provided in the checklist
- when we are satisfied that you have completed a sufficient level of testing, you will be granted access to the live API system

**Important:** Any test results submitted for production credentials must be less than 14 days old.
