# Apply for production credentials 

Accreditation testing in the NCTS5 Trader Test environment is split into 2 phases, so you will need to make 2 applications for CTC Traders API v2.0 production credentials.

## First production credentials application

You will need to submit your first production credentials application form and test results by 31 October 2023 if you want to have production credentials for the API before NCTS5 goes live on 16 November (day 1). You can still apply for credentials after 31 October, but you would not be guaranteed to receive your credentials in time for day 1 or the first few days thereafter.

If you submit your accreditation testing results and completed application after we switch to NCTS5 on 16 November 2023, you will need to allow at least 2 weeks from the date you submit the completed form to our Software Developer Support Team before you move to production.

## Second production credentials application

During phase 2, you will complete your NCTS5 final rules testing in NCTS5 Trader Test as part of your assurance and accreditation testing.

When you have completed your NCTS5 final rules testing for accreditation purposes, you will submit your test results and completed application form to our Software Developer Support Team.

## Submitting a production credentials application

When you are confident that your software is fully compatible with NCTS5 and you want to apply for production credentials for the API:

- log all your evidence and test results by filling in all sections of the CTC Traders API Application for Production Credentials Checklist (pending) - you must also answer all of the questions at the end of the checklist
- when ready, email your completed form to [SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk)
- we will check your test evidence using the information you provided in the checklist
- when we are satisfied that you have completed a sufficient level of testing, you will be granted access to the live API system

**Important:** Any test results submitted for accreditation must be less than 14 days old.
