# Testing process

You must test the compatibility of your software with [CTC Traders API v2.0](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/2.0) and, depending on your requirements, you should also test for push-pull notifications.

## Testing your software

To test your software, download the test data and test scenarios from GitHub. 

**Note:** You must use test data and test scenarios for both Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

You can also access cURL commands on GitHub, which will give you examples of how to connect to our API. You can use the following cURL commands to simulate:

- your software applicationâ€™s actions and messages
- the actions and messages that would come back from the NCTS

## Testing for push-pull notifications

When testing your software, you can use our [Push Pull Notifications API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/push-pull-notifications-api/1.0) to ensure that notifications relating to the CTC Traders API are sent to you automatically. This means that notifications from the NCTS are sent to your software in near real time.

To get these automatic messages, you must:

- subscribe to the Push Pull Notifications service
- subscribe to the CTC Traders API in the sandbox environment
- configure the notification URL in the subscription configuration section of our Developer Hub

**Note:** If your endpoint is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must use either [edge-optimised custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-edge-optimized-custom-domain-name.html) or [regional custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html).
