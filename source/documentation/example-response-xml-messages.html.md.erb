# Example XML response messages

To facilitate your test planning and testing in NCTS5 Trader Test, we have created a selection of example XML response messages and put them in a [zip file](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-testing-guide/downloads/NCTS5_Trader_Test_XML_Example_Responses_v2.zip) on GitHub.

**Note:** These example XML messages are intended to serve only as supplementary information and they are not connected in any way to the example XML messages in the NCTS5 Trader Test pack. Please refer to the [NCTS phase 5 technical interface specification](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-tis/) for accurate and comprehensive information about how the fields in NCTS5 message types should be utilised.
